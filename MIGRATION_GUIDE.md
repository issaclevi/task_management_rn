# Expo to React Native CLI Migration Guide

This guide documents the complete migration from Expo to React Native CLI while maintaining the same functionality and folder structure.

## ✅ What Has Been Migrated

### 1. Project Structure
- ✅ Created new React Native CLI project (`TaskAppRN`)
- ✅ Migrated all source code with same folder structure:
  - `src/app/` - App-level providers and configuration
  - `src/features/` - Feature-based modules (auth, admin, home, tasks, map)
  - `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `src/libs/` - Utility libraries (API, location, push notifications)
  - `src/config/` - App configuration
  - `src/theme/` - Styling and theming
  - `src/ui/` - UI components

### 2. Navigation System
- ✅ **Replaced**: Expo Router → React Navigation
- ✅ **New**: `App.tsx` with React Navigation stack navigator
- ✅ **Maintained**: Same screen structure and navigation flow
- ✅ **Added**: TypeScript navigation types for type safety

### 3. Push Notifications
- ✅ **Replaced**: Firebase FCM + Expo Notifications → OneSignal
- ✅ **New**: `src/libs/push/oneSignalService.ts`
- ✅ **Features**: 
  - Push notification registration/unregistration
  - Local notifications
  - User targeting with tags
  - External user ID management
  - Notification click handling

### 4. Location Services
- ✅ **Replaced**: expo-location → react-native-geolocation-service
- ✅ **New**: `src/libs/location/locationService.ts`
- ✅ **Features**:
  - Current location retrieval
  - Location tracking with callbacks
  - Geofencing with enter/exit events
  - Background location permissions
  - Location-based notifications

### 5. Maps Integration
- ✅ **Replaced**: expo-maps → react-native-maps
- ✅ **Ready**: Android and iOS map configurations
- ✅ **Compatible**: Existing map components will work with minimal changes

### 6. Dependencies
- ✅ **Core Navigation**: @react-navigation/native, @react-navigation/native-stack
- ✅ **State Management**: @tanstack/react-query (unchanged)
- ✅ **Storage**: @react-native-async-storage/async-storage (unchanged)
- ✅ **HTTP Client**: axios (unchanged)
- ✅ **Location**: react-native-geolocation-service
- ✅ **Push**: react-native-onesignal
- ✅ **Maps**: react-native-maps
- ✅ **Permissions**: Built-in React Native permissions

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### 1. OneSignal Setup
1. Create OneSignal account and app
2. Update `src/app/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` with your OneSignal App ID
3. Configure Android: Update `android/app/src/main/res/values/onesignal_config.xml`
4. Configure iOS: Add push notification capabilities in Xcode
5. See `ONESIGNAL_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

### 2. Maps Setup (Android)
1. Get Google Maps API key from Google Cloud Console
2. Add to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<meta-data
  android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
  android:value="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"/>
```

### 3. Maps Setup (iOS)
1. Add to `ios/TaskAppRN/Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs location access to show your position on the map.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs location access for geofencing features.</string>
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Install iOS Dependencies
```bash
cd TaskAppRN/ios && pod install
```

### 2. Configure OneSignal
- Follow `ONESIGNAL_SETUP.md` instructions
- Replace placeholder App IDs with real ones

### 3. Test on Physical Devices
```bash
# Android
npm run android

# iOS
npm run ios
```

### 4. Update Backend Integration
- Update backend to work with OneSignal instead of Firebase
- Modify push notification sending logic
- Update user device token management

## 📱 Platform-Specific Notes

### Android
- ✅ Permissions configured in AndroidManifest.xml
- ✅ OneSignal configuration files created
- ✅ Location and notification permissions added
- 🔧 Requires: Google Maps API key configuration

### iOS
- ✅ Basic project structure ready
- 🔧 Requires: CocoaPods installation (`pod install`)
- 🔧 Requires: Push notification capabilities in Xcode
- 🔧 Requires: Location usage descriptions in Info.plist

## 🔄 Key Differences from Expo

### Advantages
- ✅ **Full Native Control**: Access to all native APIs and libraries
- ✅ **Better Performance**: No Expo runtime overhead
- ✅ **Custom Native Modules**: Can add any native functionality
- ✅ **Smaller Bundle Size**: Only includes what you use
- ✅ **Production Ready**: No Expo Go limitations

### Considerations
- 🔧 **More Setup**: Requires platform-specific configuration
- 🔧 **Native Dependencies**: Need to manage iOS/Android builds
- 🔧 **Device Testing**: Must test on physical devices for push notifications
- 🔧 **Build Process**: More complex build and deployment process

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Running the App
```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# Run on Android
npm run android

# Run on iOS
npm run ios

# Clean builds
npm run clean
```

### Building for Production
```bash
# Android Release
npm run android:release

# iOS Release
npm run ios:release
```

## 📋 Testing Checklist

- [ ] App launches successfully on both platforms
- [ ] Login/authentication works
- [ ] Navigation between screens works
- [ ] Location permissions granted
- [ ] Push notifications received (on physical device)
- [ ] Maps display correctly
- [ ] Geofencing triggers notifications
- [ ] All API calls work correctly

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Metro bundler errors**: Run `npm run start:reset`
2. **iOS build errors**: Run `cd ios && pod install`
3. **Android build errors**: Run `npm run clean:android`
4. **Push notifications not working**: Check OneSignal configuration
5. **Location not working**: Verify permissions in device settings

### Getting Help
- Check React Native documentation
- Review OneSignal React Native SDK docs
- Check platform-specific setup guides
- Test on physical devices for push notifications and location features
